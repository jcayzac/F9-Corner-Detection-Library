# F9 Corner Detection Library

**F9 Corner Detection Library** is an open source implementation of the [FAST-9 corner detection algorithm](http://www.edwardrosten.com/work/fast.html), which avoids many re-allocations and tries to generally perform better.

> **Note:** This code is pretty old, and only kept for reference. A more modern approach would probably involve using the GPU instead of doing everything on the CPU.

The library consists of a single source file (__f9.cpp__) and a public header file (__f9.h__), and can be packaged as a static or shared library as well as built directly into your projects.

**Update Feb, 1st 2017:** [@jwijffels](https://github.com/jwijffels) created an R package around this code, which you can find at https://github.com/bnosac/image.CornerDetectionF9

## API

See [f9.h](//github.com/jcayzac/F9-Corner-Detection-Library/blob/master/f9.h).

**Multithread support:** The F9 context (C API) and the F9 class (C++ API) are not thread-safe, but it's easy to create one of these for each thread where you need to perform corner detection (the library _is_ reentrant). You could for instance split a big image in four tiles and detect its corners in four threads, using four F9 contexts/instances in total.
